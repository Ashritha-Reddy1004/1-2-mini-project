# 1-2-mini-project
I wanted to develop a mini project every sem during my B.Tech using the core subjects in that sem.
I had C programming in 1-2 and I came with the idea of E-progress card because at that time even covid was at high peak.
I thought this would be more scalable during that time.
Go through the code and any suggestions are welcomed.
